  <h2 class="mb-4">About HealthRisk AI</h2>
  <p>This web app helps users understand their health risks based on personal data like age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and lifestyle habits.</p>

  <p>It uses a machine learning model built with PyTorch, served via Flask, and designed with Bootstrap. The model evaluates inputs and returns a risk level with optional recommendations.</p>

  <p>Created with ❤️ by a young dev passionate about machine learning and health tech. Check out the source code on <a href="https://github.com/peejaykoy12345/HealthRisk-AI" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
